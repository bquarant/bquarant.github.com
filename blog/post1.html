	<strong><em>Finally.</em></strong><br><br>
	<p>It's taken far, far too long to get this show on the road. Too many previous, failed attempts; too many half-baked blogging interfaces; too much, but not enough.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I've tried getting a blog started a couple times in the past, but it's never quite worked out. I've tried a handful of next-generation blogging sites, which has made making, sharing, and participating in other's content trivially simple. But, for one reason or another, none of these solutions ever really appealed to me deeply, and accordingly I've never settled down with one. </p>
	<br>
	<p>Now I'm trying it again, this time with the help of <a href="#">Github Pages</a> and <a href="">Bootstrap</a>. My day-to-day workflow is conducive to this combination over other web-based blogging solutions; most days I am editing text files and executing things in terminal. So, it makes sense if I can simply generate new blog post files with a couple keystrokes, edit them quickly in vim, then finally push them up to update everything, then this is what I should be doing in order to create and publish blog content. I must have stolen this idea from a number of like-minded folks, who will get credit if and when I can put a name on them.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Additionally combination of software also gives me the ability to manage the rest of <a href="http://brian.quaran.to">brian.quaran.to</a> at the same time. This to me is incredibly important, because I'm trying to improve my web programming and development skills, so keeping the "communication" center as close as possible to the "project" center will (hopefully) only reinforce these two sections. Over the next couple of months, I'll be doing a lot of work building a couple of web apps that I've been waiting to do for a while and taking a web-based course on natural language programming, so it makes sense to have a framework for writing and reflection which has been harmonized with the rest of my work flow.</p>	
	<br>
	<p>Oh! And perhaps only to fulfill first-post stereotypes, perhaps I should wax on about what I hope to cover here. I want to use this space in order to communicate with whomever wants to read about issues that I think are important. I initially sub-titled the blog on my homepage as "a place for e-pedagogy, reflection, and learning", and I think that this allows for the breadth of discussion that will undoubtedly take place here. I'm going to shoot for entries of approximately 500-750 words every few days, but this is just to fulfill a more-or-less personal quota that I calculated a while back. Content types? Project/life progress notes, reflections, brain storms, criticism, reviews, and perhaps a rant or two. I think that should be sufficient enough to explain the task at hand.</p>
