	<p>Rarely do I ever feel bad for someone giving a TED talk.</p>
	<p>But by the end of Myshkin Ingawale's recent talk, <a href ="">"A blood test without bleeding"</a>  I realized that this was likely the last time I would ever hear about the guy. It's not that he is addressing an unimportant question or that his product doesn't work.  But given what this man has set out to do; I hope I'm wrong.</p>
	<p>Ingawale is one of the engineers behind BioSense's new product line, ToucHb. He became acutely cognizant of the state-of-the-art of public health care while he was visiting a doctor friend of his in India recently, when he bore witness to the death of a mother and child after she developed post-partum hemorrhaging. Seeing what appears to be a clear-cut problem with known solutions, Ingawale and colleagues set out to design a tool that would reduce barriers to intervention of this problem.    I'd like to agree with almost every aspect of his talk: 
		<ol> <i class="icon-chevron-right"></i><strong>Anemia is a substantial problem which affects over two <em>billion</em> people worldwide, and disproportionately affects the world's poor.</strong> This isn't news. The World Health Organization's (WHO) first report on the matter is from <a href="http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_182.pdf">October 1959</a>[footnote]; this landmark study not only describes the association between maternal anemia and high infant and mother mortality but goes further to detail what are now well-known remedies: dietary changes, parasitism control, food fortification, and prophylactic iron for those in critical need. In the five decades which have transpired since this publication, the WHO has written some six more reports, which has given extensive insight on the <a href="http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/micronutrients/anaemia_iron_deficiency/9789241596657/en/index.html">extent of micronutrient problems across the world</a> as well as <a href="http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/micronutrients/guidelines_for_Iron_supplementation.pdf">establishing guidelines</a> on how to treat such deficiencies. It is important to note that in all of these reports, hemoglobin (mg/L) was being measured with a blood draw protocol.</ol>
		<ol> <i class="icon-chevron-right"></i><strong>Plethysmography to detect total hemoglobin is a reasonable intervention for detecting anemia.</strong> Plethysmography isn't exactly ground-breaking technology; anyone who has been to a hospital recently likely has had a finger monitor placed to detect oxygen saturation. The only trouble, as Ingawale alludes to throughout his talk, is that while sophisticated technology has been developed to monitor oxygenated versus deoxygenated hemoglobin, calculating a total hemoglobin value involves a different approach to the mathematics underlying the device's functionality. A review of the literature relevant to this problem  was published in 2008 in the peer-reviewed journal <em>Clinical Chemistry</em> entitled <a href="http://www.clinchem.org/content/54/2/264.full.pdf">"Noninvasive Optical, Electrical, and Acoustic Methods of Total Hemoglobin Determination"</a> by McMurdy and colleagues. The methodologies deconstructed are exhaustive and tongue-twisting; Table 1 provides an overview of the 13 major studies highlighted by the review, accompanied with each study's intra-technique correlation coefficient and sample size, nearly all of which are highly statistically significant. The authors laud the achievements of the researchers who they cite before describing the pitfalls to adaptation to this technology by clinicians, explaining that "the complicated nature of data collection, necessary instrumentation, and inaccuracy/repeatability issues" have been limiting. The authors then conclude with a suitable prologue to Ingawale's TED talk: "Efficient penetration [...] hinges on the simplification and miniaturization of these devices so they can be implemented easily into patient care while maintaining clinically acceptable performance." </ol> 
		<ol> <i class="icon-chevron-right"></i><strong>"Democratizing" health care is critically important to respond to all public health crises.</strong> Ingawale, while he seems to dismiss his insight into this sub-domain. Herein lies added value of the ToucHb:  without exposure to blood, it follows that there will be a decreased likelihood of transmission of  blood borne pathogens</ol></p>[[finish]]
	<p><strong>Ingawale's problem is design.</strong>There was a point in his talk where he unhooks the clasps to an ever-so-typical red leather medic bag, revealing the device: a preposterously antiquated appearing grey knuckled rectangular box connected to an equally unappealing darker-grey cord with attached finger clamp. The only semblance of decoration on this device is a single line black-and-white liquid crystal display gracing the front of the display just superior to three puzzlingly-labeled buttons. There was a palpable lump in the audience's throat which, when finally swallowed a split second later, yielded at best a shuffling applause. Ingawale then holds the device still for inspection; describing the trials and tribulations of his team's 32 iterations of the product which have led to this day. The camera pans in: the device meets the recommendations of McMurdy and colleagues; it has both miniaturized and simplified the plethysmograph into a portable, reproducible device which even an a relatively less educated healthcare worker can easily read, interpret, and intervene. But here, the critical moment - the close-up - the product fails to capture the soul of the audience. There is no proof of concept; Ingawale never demonstrates his device on the world stage. A collective expression of "this won't be enough" sighs from the room, and the world is left with a sworn message; "I will sell these to all the clinics in the world," Ingawale says. </p>
	<p><strong>Lesson: harness the power of symbols.</strong> Ingawale's device can solve the problem, but as it stands, it remains an unappealing solution. Perhaps the product design was focused on a bottom line, not a ideal. ToucHb is  Fund mobilization depends on branding, and product design is a step that cannot be missed.</p> [[finish]]
