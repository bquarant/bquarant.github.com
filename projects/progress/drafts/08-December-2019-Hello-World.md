# Rebooting bqmd.org
I've had <a href="http://bqmd.org">bqmd.org</a> registered for a few years now, and recently went through the trouble to connect it to my existing Github account to redirect the repository which was set up to autoconfigured Github Pages. I liked the idea of having a static site, one where the code was simple and there was minimal separation between the text and the page. I'm aware of the various static site generators, but I figured with Github Pages it must be simple enough to just do it yourself. So, here we go.

# Generating content
My plan is to post weekly productivity updates to Progress Notes, in order to check in with what's going on in the various projects that I'm working on. In addition, I have some topics that I'm interested in that I'll have some more in depth posts about various topics.  In the next few weeks, these will be mostly ABSITE things, and then will transition back into startup and XR development issues.

# Creating change
Without sounding too grandiose, hopefully this place will have some positive impact on others, who might read and learn something here. Or, maybe someone will find this useful and get in touch - just by sending me an <a href="mailto:quaranto@gmail.com">email</a>.
