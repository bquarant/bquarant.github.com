			<h2>Gross Human Anatomy</h2>
			<!-- <h3>Overview - Block 1</h3> -->
			<!-- <h3>Structure of the Vertebral Column</h3> -->
			<!-- <h3>Muscles and Nerves of the Back</h3> -->
			<h3>Anatomy of the Shoulder</h3>
				<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Identify bones and ligaments of the shoulder</li>
						<li>Learn the movements of the shoulder and understand the attachments, actions, and innervation of the responsible musculature</li>
					</ul>
				<p><strong>I. Bones and joints of the shoulder</strong> (Grant's Fig. 6.34)</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Scapula</strong> - a large, irregular bone that serves as the baseplate for the upper limb</li>
						<ul>
							<li><em>body</em> - slightly concave triangular bone on posterior aspect of rib cage over 2nd - 7th ribs</li>
								<ul>
									<li>three sides: superior, lateral, and medial borders</li>
									<li>three angles: superior, lateral, and inferior angles</li>
									<li><span class="label label-warning">Clinical Correlate</span> The borders and angles of the scapula are used for anatomical landmarks (i.e. triangle of auscultation)</li>
								</ul>
							<li><em>spine</em> - narrow ridge of bone running transversely from spinous process of T3 to acromion</li>
							<li><em>acromion</em> - the flat lateral end of the spine, "point of the shoulder"</li>
							<li><em>glenoid fossa</em> - cup-shaped lateral surface allowing articulation of the humerus</li>
							<li><em>coracoid process</em> - anterolateral projection, "crow-head"</li>
						</ul>
						<li><strong>Humerus</strong> (proximal features, see forearm lecture for distal features)</li>
						<ul>
							<li><em>head</em> - round, proximal end which articulates with the glenoid fossa</li>
							<li><em>anatomical neck</em> - constriction just distal to head, location of the epiphyseal plate</li>
							<li><em>surgical neck</em> - further narrowing distal to anatomical neck, location of common humeral fractures</li>
							<li><em>greater tubercle</em> - slight projection on lateral surface of the humerus, serves as attachment sites for rotator cuff muscles</li>
							<li><em>lesser tubercle</em> - even smaller projection on anterior surface, also serves as an attachment site for the rotator cuff muscles</li>
							<li><em>intertubercular groove</em> - separates the greater and lesser tubercles, also known ass the bicipital groove</li>
							<li><em>deltoid tuberosity</em> - ridge on lateral surface where deltoid musculature attaches</li>
						</ul>
						<li><strong>Muscles of the humerus</strong> (proximal features, see forearm lecture for distal features)</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Movements occur at the glenohumeral joint (a ball-and socket type joint) and are connected with the assistance of</li>
							<ul>
								<li><em>glenoid labrum</em> - rim of fibrocartilidge that makes a larger "cup" for the head of the humerus</li>
								<li><em>articular capsule</em> - thin capsule surrounding the joint, attaches glenoid cavity to anatomical neck of the humerus. It is lined by a synovial membrane which is filled with synovial fluid to allow for joint lubrication, also known as a <strong>bursa</strong>. The anterior thickening of the articular capsule is also known as the glenohumeral ligament.</li>
								<li><em>coracohumeral ligament</em> - attaches base of coracoid process to the articular capsule</li>
							</ul>
						<li><em>coracoacromial ligament</em> - forms an arch that prevents the upward displacement of the humeral head</li>
						<li><em>tendon of the long head of the biceps brachii</em> - loops over humeral head and attaches to superior lip of the glenoid fossa, resists superior dislocation of humeral head</li>
						<li><em>Rotator cuff musculature</em> - the muscles surrounding the joint provide most of the real strength and stability of the shoulder</li>
						</ul>
						<li><strong>Clavicle</strong> - extends between the sternum and acromion, acts as a strut to keep upper extremity away from the thorax</li>
						<ul>
							<li><em>Medial head of clavicle</em> - articulates with the manubrium and cartilage of the first rib to form the sternoclavicular joint</li>
							<li>It is important to note that the sternoclavicular joint is synovial and does go through a considerable range of motion when upper limb is flexed or extended, and when the scapula is retracted or protracted</li>
							<li>An articular cartilaginous disc protects the bony surfaces of the sternoclavicular joint, serves as a shock absorber</li>
							<li>This is the only articulation between the upper limb and axial skeleton.</li>
							<li><span class="label label-warning">Clinical Correlate</span> The sternoclavicular joint is held together by strong ligaments, so dislocations are rare and the clavicle generally fractures before dislocation occurs</li>
							<li>The lateral end of the clavicle articulates with the acromion of the scapula at the <em>acromioclavicular</em> joint</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Movement at this joint consists of slight rotation at the scapula relative to the clavicle during retraction and protraction.</li>
								<li>This joint has its own synovial capsule, however the joint is weak and is easy to get dislocation (a "shoulder separation")</li>
								<li><em>acromioclavicular ligament</em> - connects acromion and clavicle</li>
								<li><em>coracoclavicular ligament</em> - connects coracoid process and the clavicle, has two bands known as the conoid and trapezoid ligaments</li>
							</ul>
							<li>The clavicle has an elongated "S" shape, medial 2/3 are convex anteriorly, lateral 1/3 is concave, the weakest part being the intersection of these two curves</li>
							<li>The clavicle develops from two ossification centers (on medial, one lateral), a congenital abnormality of failure of fusion should not be misdiagnosed as a fracture</li>
						</ul>
						<li><strong>Movements and muscles of the shoulder</strong></li>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>General rule: flexion can be described as going from anatomical position to fetal position (with toes pointed), extension is going from fetal position back to anatomical position</strong></li>
							<li>Movements of the humerus</li>
								<ul>
									<li><em>flexion</em> = swinging the arm anteriorly</li>
									<li><em>extension</em> = swinging the arm posteriorly</li>
									<li><em>abduction</em> = swinging the arm laterally, taking it away from the body</li>
									<li><em>adduction</em> = bringing the arm back against the body (from an abducted position)</li>
									<li><em>medial rotation</em> = rotating the humerus on the glenoid fossa so that it turns medially; i.e., so that the hand turns toward the body from anatomical position</li>
									<li><em>lateral rotation</em> = rotating the humerus that it turns laterally; i.e., so that the hand turns outward if starting from anatomical position</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Movements of the scapula</li>
							<!-- Notes below -->
							<ul>
							<li>Scapulohumeral muscles - move arm relative to the scapula, 6 muscles</li> 
							<li>Thoracoappendicular muscles - most run from vertebral columnn and ribs, move arm indirectly by moving the scapula/clavicle</li>
							<li>Rotator cuff: (SITS) muscles over both surfaces of the scapula</li>
							<li>Supraspinatus - superior to scapular spine, attach to greater tubercle of humerus, abducts the humerus</li>
							<li>Infraspinatus - also attaches to the greater tubercule, adducts  and laterally rotates the humerus</li>
							<li>Teres minor - "small tube" attaches to the greater tubercle, runs just inferior to infraspinatus and also adducts and laterally rotates</li>
							<li>Subscapularis - runs anteriorly on scapula, attaches to lesser tubercle of the humerus, allows medial rotation and adduction of the humerus</li>
							<li>Teres major - runs deep to long head of the triceps brachii, attaches near the intertubercular groove. Adducts and medially rotates the humerus </li>
							<li>Deltoid - attaches to deltoid tuberosity, powerful abductor of the humerus, but can also flex and extend the humerus too if anterior/posterior muscles </li>
						</ul>
						<li>Subacromion bursa</li>
						<li>Subscapular bursa</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Thoracoappendicular musculature</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Posterior (5)</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Trapezius - attaches acromion, scapula, and spinous processes.</li>
							<li>Superior fibers are attached laterally, function to elevate the scapula by superior rotations</li>
							<li>Middle fibers - </li>
							<li>Lower fibers attach to thoracic spinous process, adduct medially but also superiorly rotate</li>
							<li>Levator scapulae - elevates the scapula, inferiorly rotates the scapula</li>
							<li>Rhomboid major/minor - mostly function to retract scapula, also contribute to inferior rotation</li>
							<li>Latissiumus dorsi - connect spinous processes of lumbar and thoracic vertebrae and attaches next to teres major in the intertubercular groove, strong adductor but also medi </li>
						</ul>
						<li>Anterior</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Serratus anterior - functions in superior rotation of the humerus contribute . CC: Winged scapula if serratus anterior is lost/paralyzed. Innervated by the the long thoracic nerve, lies on the superficial side of the muscle; a relatively </li>
							<li>Subclavius - holds scapula in place</li>
							<li>Pectoralis minor - runs from ribs to coracoid process, depresses scapula, assists in protracting</li>
							<li>Pectoralis major - "anterior equivalent of latissimus dorsi", attaches from sternum to medial clavicle to intertubercular groove. </li>
						</ul>
						<li><span class="label label-warning">Clinical Correlate</span> Deltopectoral triangle is used as a landmark for central access by means of the subclavian vein</li>
						
			  </ul>
			<h3>Vasculature of the Back, Shoulder, and Breast</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Vasculature of the back</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Most of the back is segmentally supplied by arteries at a regular, repeating pattern</li>
						<li><strong>Vertebrae</strong></li>
						<ul>
							<li>Unnamed spinal branches of arteries from vertebral and ascending cervical arteries on their superficial sides</li>
							<li>Horizontal arteries that branch from the aorta at each vertebral level</li>
								<ul>
									<li>thorax: <strong>posterior intercostal arteries</strong></li> 
									<li>lumbar: <strong>subcostal and lumbar arteries</strong></li>
									<li>pelvis: <strong>iliolumbar and lateral and medial sacral arteries</strong></li>
								</ul>
							<li>Spinal branches supply the bone with blood supply on the external surface</li>
							<li>Spinal branches also send further branches through the intervertebral foramina to supply the deep side of the bone as well as dura and arachnoid mater</li>
							<li>Unnamed arteries also continue posteriorly following the posterior rami of the spinal nerve, supplying blood to the muscles and skin</li>
							<li>The extrinsic back muscles receive blood from spinal artery branches, but are also supplied from the vasculature of the upper limbs</li>
							<li><strong>Occipital artery:</strong> the most superior branch, supplies the suboccipital triangle and continues superiorly to the skin of the posterior head</li>
							<li>Blood is drained by venous system running in neurovascular bundles with the artery</li>
							<li>These veins anastomose with the intervertebral veins which collect blood from the vertebral venous plexus</li>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>External vertebral venous plexus:</strong> drains blood from outer part of the vertebrae</li>
									<li><strong>Internal vertebral venous plexus:</strong> drains blood from the dura and arachnoid mater, spinal nerve roots, and parts of the vertebrae closer to the vertebral foramina</li>
									<li>These two plexuses are connected through intervertebral veins passing through the intervertebral space</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Intervertebral veins thenempty into:</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Neck: vertebral veins</li>
									<li>Thorax: intercostal veins</li>
									<li>Lumbar/Sacral: lumbar or sacral veins</li>
								</ul>
						</ul>
					<li><strong>Spinal Cord</strong></li>
						<ul>
							<li><em>The spinal cord has its own blood supply which is distinct but connected to the vertebral blood supply</em></li>
							<li>One anterior spinal arteries and two posterior spinal arteries run longitudinally along the surface of the spinal cord, giving off short branches which access and supply the cord</li>
							<li>Upper one third is supplied by A/P spinal arteries branching off the <strong>vertebral arteries</strong> and <strong>posterior inferior cerebellar arteries</strong></li>
							<li>Further down, the A/P spinal arteries are supplemented by <strong>segmental medullary arteries</strong>, which arise from the segmental arteries supplying the vertebrae. </li>
							<li>Cervical enlargement of the spinal cord provides nerves for the upper limbs is well supplied segmentally and cranially</li>
							<li>Lumbar enlargement is also well supplied, with spinal arteries entering via an enlarged artery entering via lower thoracic or upper lumbar intervertebral foramina </li>
							<li><strong>Radicular arteries</strong> - other branches of the segmental spinal branches that travel with spinal nerve roots but don't anastomose with the anterior or posterior spinal arteries</li>
							<li>The spinal cord is drained via the <strong>anterior and posterior spinal veins</strong> which run longitudinally on the surface of the cord. These veins are heavily interconnected and resemble the vertebral venous plexus and are also heavily interconnected with the internal vertebral venous plexus</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<li>Vasculature of the upper limb - the lateral cervical region</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Origin and Boundaries</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Buds for upper limbs form at the C3-T2 vertebral levels, so the nerves and blood supplies to the upper limb come through the neck</li>
							<li>Boundaries</li>
							<ul>
								<li>1. Superior border of the trapezius</li>
								<li>2. The clavicle</li>
								<li>3. The sternocleidomastoid</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Protects cartoid artery and internal jugular vein</li>
										<li>Contracted bilaterally: pulls head anteriorly</li>
										<li>Contracted unilaterally: rotates and tilts head on contracting side</li>
										<li>Innervated by CN XI</li>
									</ul>
								<li>4. The investing layer of deep cervical fascia (roof)</li>
								<li>5. The prevertebral fascia (floor)</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
						<li>Other musculature of the lateral cervical region (and deeper)</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Posterior belly of the <strong>omohyoid muscle</strong> connects the scapula and hyoid bone, and serves to move and stabilize the hyoid</li>
								<li>The <strong>subclavius</strong> holds the clavicle against the ribcage, protects in case of fracture</li>
								<li><strong>Scalenes</strong>: anterior, middle, and posterior connect transverse processes of C2-C7 to rib 1 and 2</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Gap between anterior and middle scalene known as the <strong>interscalene triange</strong> and allows passage of the subclavian artery and brachial plexus</li>
										<li>Contracted bilaterally: raise ribs 1, 2 for work of breathing</li>
										<li>Contracted unilaterally: flex neck laterally</li>
									</ul>
							</ul>
						<li>Blood vessels in the lateral cervical region</li>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>External jugular vein</strong> crosses the sternocleidomastoid, piercing the deep cervical fascia before draining into the subclavian vein</li>
								<li>The <strong>subclavian vein</strong> passes anterior to the anterior scalene, and receives blood from the upper limb</li>
								<li>The <strong>subclavian artery</strong> passes deep to the anterior scalene, where it is more protected</li>
									<ul>
										<li>The <strong>thyrocervical trunk</strong> is a short branch off the first part of the subclavian artery</li>
										<li>The thyrocervical trunk then has another branch known as the cervicodorsal trunk or <strong>transverse cervical artery</strong>, which branches into the <strong>superficial cervical artery</strong> and the <strong>dorsal scapular artery</strong> (the latter supplies the levator scapulae and rhomboid musculature) </li>
										<li>The <strong>suprascapular artery</strong> is also a branch off the thyrocervical trunk</li>
										<li>The <strong>vertebral artery</strong> is another branch off the subclavian artery, see above for further details</li>
									</ul>
							</ul>
						</ul>
						<li>The axilla - the continued route to the upper limb</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The <strong>axilla</strong> is a relatively protected region in the inferior part of the junction between the arm, neck, and thorax</li>
							<li>Boundaries</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Apex of pyramid: gap between the first rib, clavicle, and scapula</li>
									<li>Anterior wall: fold formed by pectoralis major and pectoralis minor as they bridge the space between the thorax and upper limb</li>
									<li>Posterior wall: fold formed by the subscapularis, teres major, and latissimus dorsi as they bridge the space between the thorax and upper limb</li>
									<li>Medial wall: upper part of the serratus anterior, upper ribs, and intercostal musculature</li>
									<li>Lateral wall: the floor of the intertubercular groove on the humerus</li>
									<li>Base of the pyramid: the skin lining the "armpit"</li>
									<li>The vessels and nerves in the axilla are all continuations of structures we have identified above, and are all contained within a loose sheet of fascia known as the <strong>axillary sheath</strong></li>
								</ul>
							<li>Blood supply of the arm, forearm, and hand:</li>
								<ul>
									<li>The <strong>axillary artery</strong> is just a continuation of the subclavian artery, name changes after artery emerges from under the clavicle at the lateral border of the first rib</li>
									<ul>
									<li>The axillary artery subsequently becomes the <strong>brachial artery</strong> after emerging from beneath inferior border of teres major</li>
									<li>First part of the axillary artery</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Located between lateral border of 1st rib and medial border of pectoralis minor</li>
											<li>Has one branch: the <strong>superior thoracic artery</strong>, which supplies the first and 2nd intercostal spaces</li>
										</ul>
									<li>Second part of the axillary artery</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Located deep to pectoralis minor, has two branches</li>
											<li>Branch one: <strong>thoracoacromial artery</strong>, branches into acromial, deltoid, and pectoral branches</li>
											<li>Branch two: <strong>lateral thoracic artery</strong>, descends along lateral border of pectoralis major and supplies pectoralis musculature, axillary lymph nodes, and lateral part of the breast. Origin variability possible, either from thoracoacromial artery or from the subscapular </li>
										</ul>
									<li>Third part of the axillary artery</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Located from the lateral border of the pectoralis minor to the inferior border of teres major, has three branches</li>
											<li>Branch one: <strong>anterior humeral circumflex artery</strong>: small, laterally runnning proximal branch, anterior to humerus and wraps around surgical neck. Supplies the lateral part of the shoulder</li>
											<li>Branch two: <strong>posterior humeral circumflex artery</strong>: runs with the axillary nerve through the posterior wall of the axilla via the <strong>quadrangular space</strong> and supplies the deltoid, teres minor, teres major, and the long head of the triceps brachii</li>
											<li>Branch three: <strong>subscapular artery</strong>: largest and most important branch of the axillary artery, descends thoracic wall along lateral border of the subscapularis, splits into the <strong>circumflex scapular artery</strong> which supplies the muscles on the posterior scapula. The subscapular artery also branches </li>
